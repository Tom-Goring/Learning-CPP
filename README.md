# Learning-CPP
Exercises and Projects to learn C++

## Currently Implemented:

1. Basic class experimentation
2. Binary to Decimal and back converter
3. Collatz number step calculator - I might consider learning how to call C++ from python and use python
to draw a graph of the steps.
4. Implementation of an NQueens solver using depth first search - Given a starting column in row 0 it will find
a solution.
